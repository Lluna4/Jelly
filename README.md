# Jelly
A simple minecraft server made in c++ thats in development!
## Build
To build the project you have to simply make a build folder and enter into it `mkdir build && cd build` configure cmake `cmake ..` and then build the project `cmake --build .`, the project has dependencies with [crashoz/uuid_v4](https://github.com/crashoz/uuid_v4) and [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) so please install uuidv4 and put nlohmann_json in the same directory as the project
## Features
This project aims to be a simple minecraft server for me to learn but also to be as inclusive as possible, for now it has pronouns built in that can be changed with `/pronouns <pronouns>` but i also plan to provide support for plural systems in the future
